# vetur

Vue tooling for VSCode.  

This extension is in development and not stable yet.  
You can [open an issue](https://github.com/octref/vetur/issues/new) for bugs or feature requests.

## Implemented Features

- Basic IntelliSense for html/css/scss/less/js
- Advanced IntelliSense to suggest `v-` directives and `key`, `ref`, `slot` as html attributes
- Linting for js via ESLint, basic error checking for css/scss/less
- Formatting for html/css/scss/less/js
- Syntax highlighting for:
  - html/jade/pug
  - css/sass/scss/less/stylus/postcss
  - js/ts/coffee
- Embedded snippet support
  - Use vue snippet outside all regions
  - Use each language's snippet inside its region (Only for self-defined snippet. Extension-contributed snippet only works in insiders now, but
    will be available in March release)
- Emmet for html/css/sass/scss/less
